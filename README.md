# Text Generation Project

This project involves training a deep learning model for text generation using a dataset of Shakespeare's works. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and can generate new text based on an initial input string.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment tool (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   \`\`\`

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   \`\`\`bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use \`venv\\Scripts\\activate\`
   \`\`\`

3. **Install Dependencies**

   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

4. **Download the Dataset**

   Run the \`download_data.py\` script to download the dataset.

   \`\`\`bash
   python download_data.py
   \`\`\`

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, run the \`train.py\` script located in the \`src\` directory. This script will preprocess the data, build the model, and save checkpoints during training.

\`\`\`bash
python src/train.py
\`\`\`

### Generating Text

To generate text using the trained model, run the \`generate.py\` script located in the \`src\` directory. Make sure the model checkpoints are present in the \`checkpoints\` directory.

\`\`\`bash
python src/generate.py
\`\`\`

### Example Output

After running the generation script, you should see an output similar to:

\`\`\`
To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them.
\`\`\`

## Additional Notes

- **Checkpoints**: Ensure that the \`checkpoints\` directory exists and contains the saved model weights.
- **.gitignore**: The \`.gitignore\` file is configured to ignore unnecessary files and directories, such as virtual environments and temporary files.
- **Exploration Notebook**: The \`exploration.ipynb\` notebook contains code for data exploration and experimentation.
